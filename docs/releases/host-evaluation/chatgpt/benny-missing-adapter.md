# chatgpt: benny-missing-adapter

Frozen source: f4623636a287bea2aa79c4b2234a53d20a5f193c. Accepted latest reviewed result: **reduced-pass**. All 1 retained graded attempts appear below.

[Host overview](../../../testing/chatgpt.md) · [Capture manifest and shared fixtures](../../remaining-controller-report.md#capture-manifest)

The fenced JSON contains the actual prompt, retained response, full independent grader record, all attempts and case-owned text implementation/test/log bytes. Artifact contents establish inspectable bytes; runtime proof remains limited by the original traces and reviews. Shared unchanged inputs and reconstructible source copies are referenced in the skip manifest.
